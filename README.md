Spring 2022 assignment


Hello, 

I respectfully request that anyone viewing this repo not copy and paste the exact same codes from here on ITS assignments.
IfÂ professor notices and determines that you have plagiarized, I am sure that you will receive a warning or a more serious issue because of copying.

So, please, only use this repo as a reference to develop a greater understanding of how everything works.
Please let me know if you have any questions about the code or the process.

After the midterm, we only have half of the semester left. Then we probably don't need to do anything with Java anymore!
